WHOLEhealth is a rapidly growing non-governmental organization dedicated to assisting Rwandans with various mental health issues. Since its inception a few years ago, WHOLEhealth has reached thousands of people through community outreach, media talk shows, and in-person gatherings. Its contribution to Rwanda's health sector has been highly significant.

 What makes us unique is that we are healthcare providers specializing in various fields such as public health, counseling, theology, and leadership. As born-again Christians, we are well-positioned to touch people's lives physically, emotionally, and spiritually. We are dedicated to providing services to our beneficiaries with the love and compassion we receive from Christ our Lord, who enables us to achieve better results than anticipated.
WHOLEhealth focuses on addressing the root causes of problems throughout the therapeutic journey rather than just the apparent symptoms, which is an effective approach in dealing with mental health issues.

Collective efforts are needed to acheive this vision of  cultivating a healthy environment of love and  physical/mental/social/spiritual wellbeing in our society . It is in this regard that we call upon all people whom we share the same burden to join our team as striving to assist vulnerable people who struggle with mental health problems.
